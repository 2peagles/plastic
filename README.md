#Getting Started

    I must admit I could have done the css in a better way it's messy. This is a nice one pager recreation of we ain't plastic 

    I'm close to being done and I hope it looks spot on to the offical site, I couldn't find the oak style they used ;( 
    
    I learned about the before and after sudeo class, which is really cool. It's rather simple but does so much CSS real is it's amazing.
